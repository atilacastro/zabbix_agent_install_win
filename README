.NAME
 Zabbix Agent Install.
.SYNOPSIS
 Installs Zabbix Agent Service and starts it.
.Descripton
 Checks if the service exists and whether it's in a "Stopped" state. If it exists and is stopped it will start the service, otherwise it will copy
 the Zabbix Agent folder (with the Agent and Config) to the "C:\" drive it will then create a new Service and start the service.
 
.Remarks
 This can then be deployed via GPO or other means. 
 This coupled with a discovery rule in the Zabbix app will set the host up.
 Ensure that you have set the configuration file correctly for your Zabbix setup BEFORE deploying.
